### Technologies Used:

jQuery, Express, Node



### Process:

1. I chose to go the jQueryAJAX route since I haven't set up API routes with React/React Router before. 
2. The first step in my process was to check the API and make sure the access key was working and I was able to view the json. I use Postman to GET/POST/PUT/DELETE and everything worked great. 
3. Next step was sketching a wireframe of where the different components would go (Menu items, order ticket, order button, etc. ) and the steps the user would take.
4. Then I worked displaying the menu elements, adding them to the order form, calculating the subtotal
5. My next step would be to add an "open new ticket" button that would grab the menu items I clicked on, grab the  selected table id and POST a new check.
